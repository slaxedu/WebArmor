1- intelx.io:
   1.1 main website : has an academic plan
         for students with api access and full
         access to public leaks , wiki leaks and 
         more , have a look :
         https://intelx.io/product (free tires
         section)
   
   1.2 Phonbook.cz : a part of intelx's plan*
          Provides you with emails,urls and
          domains or subdomains of a given
          domain that were found in intelx's
          search results 
          its api has some search times
          limitations but it will be enough I think

2- Breachdirectory.org : 
   2.1 main website : a massive directory 
          for data breaches
          (username/email/phone_number: password) the website has a search bar
          you can use to search for data
          breaches but the result is 1-sh hashed
          so it's useless and un scrapeable 

 2.2 Breach directory's api : what I've found
         lately that you can search with domain 
         and the api response will have every
         data breach of an email_only or
         (email:password) under this given
         domain and it's super fast 
         unfortunately their api is only available
         on rapid api platform , they have no
         academia plan and their free plan has 
         a limit (10 requests per month) so we
         can create two accounts with 2 api
         keys one for testing and the other for 
         the final project I think it will be enough 
         because every search request brings
         back every data breach of a domain's 
         emails 
    

Note: we can use breachdirectory only instead of using Phonebook  and then using breachdirectory
